The game of tic-tac-toe, also spelled ticktacktoe and also known as 3-in-a-row or "naughts and crosses," is a game in which players alternate placing pieces (typically Xs for the first player and Os for the second) on a 3×3 board. The first player to get three pieces in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) is the winner.

For the usual 3×3 board, a draw can always be obtained, making it a futile game.

A generalized n-in-a-row on an k×m board can also be considered, as can a generalization to a three-dimensional "board." The game consisting of getting five (or more) in a row on a board variously considered to be of size 13×13 or 15×15 is known as go-moku. The specific case of 4×4×4 tic-tac-toe is known as qubic.

For 2-in-a-row on any board larger than 1×2, the first player has a trivial win. In "revenge" tic-tac-toe (in which n-in-a-row wins, but loses if the opponent can make n-in-a-row on the next move), even 2-in-a-row is non-trivial. For instance, n=2 on a 1×5 board is won for the first player if he starts in the second or fourth square, but not if he starts elsewhere.

In 3-in-a-row, the first player wins for any board at least 3×4. The first player also wins on a 3×3 board with an augmented corner square, with three distinct winning first moves (Gardner 1978).

If the board is at least 5×6, the first player can win for  n=4 (the 5×5 board is a draw). The game is believed to be a draw for 4×7, is undecided for 4×8, believed to be a proven win for 4×9, and has been proved as a win for 4×11 by means of variation trees (Ma).

For n=5, a draw can always be obtained on a 5×5 board, but the first player can win if the board is at least 15×15. The cases n=6 and 7 have not yet been fully analyzed for an n×n board, although draws can always be forced for n=8 and 9.

In higher dimensions, for any n-in-a-row, there exists a dimension d board (n×n×...×n) with a winning strategy for the first player (Hales and Jewett 1963). The Hales-Jewett theorem, a central result in Ramsey theory, even allows for more than two players, a dimension d will still exist that gives a first player win. For 3×3×3 and 4×4×4, the first player can always win (Gardner 1979), thus establishing d=3 for n=3 and n=4. For n=8, Golomb has proven d>3 with a Hales-Jewett pairing strategy (Ma 2005). Values of d for other n are unknown, and the Hales-Jewett theorem does not help, as it is existential and not constructive.
